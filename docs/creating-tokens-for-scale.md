## Colors
### Functional colors
Functional colors are create with color box. This allows us to fine tune every color to have ideal contrast with backgrounds and type.
Our current setup can be found here: https://colorbox.io/?c0=%26p%24s%24%3D11%26p%24h%24st%24%3D225%26p%24h%24e%24%3D230%26p%24h%24c%24%3Deqo%26p%24sa%24st%24%3D0.1%26p%24sa%24e%24%3D1%26p%24sa%24r%24%3D1%26p%24sa%24c%24%3Deqo%26p%24b%24st%24%3D1%26p%24b%24e%24%3D0.75%26p%24b%24c%24%3Deqi%26o%24n%24%3DBlue%26o%24ms%24%3D%5B%5D%26o%24ro%24%3Dcw&c1=%26p%24s%24%3D11%26p%24h%24st%24%3D30%26p%24h%24e%24%3D15%26p%24h%24c%24%3Dl%26p%24sa%24st%24%3D0.12%26p%24sa%24e%24%3D1%26p%24sa%24r%24%3D1%26p%24sa%24c%24%3Deco%26p%24b%24st%24%3D.99%26p%24b%24e%24%3D0.58%26p%24b%24c%24%3Deqti%26o%24n%24%3DOrange%26o%24ms%24%3D%5B%5D%26o%24ro%24%3Dccw&c2=%26p%24s%24%3D11%26p%24h%24st%24%3D152%26p%24h%24e%24%3D158%26p%24h%24c%24%3Dl%26p%24sa%24st%24%3D0.25%26p%24sa%24e%24%3D1%26p%24sa%24r%24%3D1.2%26p%24sa%24c%24%3Deqo%26p%24b%24st%24%3D1%26p%24b%24e%24%3D0.41%26p%24b%24c%24%3Dl%26o%24n%24%3DGreen%26o%24ms%24%3D%5B%5D%26o%24ro%24%3Dcw&c3=%26p%24s%24%3D11%26p%24h%24st%24%3D350%26p%24h%24e%24%3D360%26p%24h%24c%24%3Dl%26p%24sa%24st%24%3D0.12%26p%24sa%24e%24%3D1%26p%24sa%24r%24%3D1%26p%24sa%24c%24%3Deco%26p%24b%24st%24%3D.91%26p%24b%24e%24%3D0.3%26p%24b%24c%24%3Deqti%26o%24n%24%3DRed%26o%24ms%24%3D%5B%5D%26o%24ro%24%3Dcw
